## We Urgently Need Your Help!

For the last few months, we have been very confident that we were on track to survive crypto winter but circumstances have changed rapidly in the last couple of days. This is a call to action because we desperately need your help in fighting to keep Supremacy Game alive, and our studio afloat. We love our community and what we have built and will do everything we can to keep this special thing alive. We are working intensely, sacrificing all that we can to deliver an amazing project and keep this thing going. We now want to open the project and inner studio workings up to the community to save our game, make it the best version possible and enable our community to be more heavily involved in the direction of Supremacy. 


##  A Game Studio with a Difference

Ninja Syndicate is building a future where game economies co-exist in new ways that provide greater real-world benefits to players and game developers. We have been working tirelessly to make this vision a reality.

We launched in February 2022 and have since grown a strong community and released an amazing first game Supremacy: Battle Arena. We are a strong company full of talented game designers and software developers. We are the largest Game Studio in Perth employing over 40 staff and developing premium game content at breakneck speed.


## Now for the Sad Part

![](https://codimd.theninja.life/uploads/upload_7706151cc6013db1a184fb4233f4aca7.gif)

The pre-seed investment we had secured, which would have allowed us to continue until market recovery, has not put the funds in our bank. The contracts are signed, but the timeline for funding has been extended again and again to the point we can no longer operate without a quick cash injection. We have therefore frantically been discussing a Plan B. 

Going back to our roots and the values we align with, we acknowledge that:

* We don’t want to be owned and fragmented by private companies if we can help it

* We want Supremacy to be a community owned and governed game 


## Why Don’t We Start a DAO for Supremacy Then?
Good question, I am glad you asked - we think we should too. In fact, it's something we discuss often in the studio to be implemented once we are further along with core development. We started seriously planning for this way back in April 2022 and came up with a heap of great ideas that tied in with Supremacy lore, but we wanted to build a solid core product first. Instead of pushing it prematurely, all employees stayed focused on getting the game play and game enjoyment levels solid first. 

A game as multifaceted as Supremacy will always be most viable and enjoyable as a community owned and driven project. Being a Web3 based game using technology still in its infancy, utilising that level of community control out of the gate would of slowed development considerably and might of broken the vision we have that has got us to here. 

Our current circumstances and how far the game has come with Nexus release means we can be confident pushing this milestone forward.  If successful, it means we can safeguard our precious game and continue with the incredible journey we have already begun and are already delivering on. It will also have better long term outcomes for the community than if we created a DAO for the game at a later date after outside investment was on board. 

Creating a DAO for Supremacy Game is a far better option for the longevity and sustainabilty of the game and means our community can become more active in the direction that it takes from here on. We believe that this game has a bright future and we want all contributors to benefit from our wins. We just need to get through this hard stage of growing our player base to the point where it needs to be to sustain itself.



## What will I Receive when I Help?

You will be given governance tokens for a new Supremacy DAO that will own Supremacy Game. Each rounds tokens have voting power in line with the 12 month emission schedule below. You will also receive bonus game related items depending on your contribution amount. Governance Tokens can be used for your right to political expression across all Supremacy games. We will release more lore related content regarding this in the weeks following a successful first round. Keep reading for more details.

More importantly, you will be a part of a project that has already had millions of dollars spent on it, hundreds of thousands of hours sank into it and know it can deliver. This is not the way projects are usually formed in this space but we think it is a good thing. Part of the risk associated with buying tokens for a project that hasn't launched yet is the uncertainty on whether the project can even ship. We ship and you already know it.  

The earlier round you join, the more voting power your tokens will hold.


## Round One: Open for Seven Days December 2 2022 to December 9 2022

**You will receive:** 

A Supremacy DAO Round One Token for every US dollar contributed. Each of these Round One tokens are worth 2 DAO votes each in line with voting power emissions schedule.

PLUS 

Pledge rewards relative to amount contributed.

## Future Rounds
Governance tokens will be distributed per round with the emissions rate for voting power set above for each dollar (USD) contributed. Bonuses will still be awarded each month depending on pledge amount, but these may change each month depending on game development. Ideally all bonuses will be available to use in game shortly after each round finishes. 


## This is the Team that can Make it (with your help)

In a landscape of promises with no deliverables, we are an outlier. We raised no initial funds from investors to build Supremacy game. Instead we bootstrapped Supremacy development through our passionate team working late hours. They stayed back night after night, for 18 months at the successful software development consultancy we ran for six years prior to pivoting into a game studio. We then leaned on our amazing local network in Perth who helped bring us to where we are today.

Once the DAO is formed and IP ownership is transferred to the DAO, we will continue to work extremely hard to make this an incredible game. It's not unheard of for members of our team to be in the office until well after midnight. Everyone here absolutely loves what they do and we are delivering at a faster speed than most people thought was possible for a team this size. The team will continue to be custodians of the DAO and game.

To put all of this information into clearer perspective you have the opportunity now to help build this game and studio even further. We want you to be a part of the decision making process for Supremacy game related decisions. Every contribution to our DAO Rounds will give you voting power to help shape this game to be the best it can be. This includes all Supremacy related game content including:

* Supremacy Battle Arena: Launched February 2022. A Mass Multiplayer Online Battle Arena set in the year 2149

* Supremacy Human Resistance: First Person Shooter (FPS) version of the Battle Arena on track to launch Q1 2023

* Supremacy Grand Strategy: A Real Time Strategy (RTS)  game where you can mine resources and build an empire. Due for launch Q4 2023

**AND**

* Supremacy World: The unifying force that brings all Supremacy game titles together. On track for beta launch Q1 2023


## How will Project Salvation Work?


We will open a Recovery Fund effective immediately. 

This will function as the funnel for a DAO treasury to fund ongoing Supremacy game development. 

- All future revenue generated in the Supremacy Game storefront will also directly go to the DAO treasury
- All future grants or investment into Supremacy Game will also go into the DAO treasury

Additonally we will:

- Transfer IP ownership of Supremacy Game to be owned by the DAO which is controlled through DAO token holders
- We will transfer Supremacy game servers to the DAO
- We will transfer the entire SUPS treasury to the DAO 

The Soft cap for Round One is 300k. If we do not reach this amount, all contributions will be refunded and the DAO will not be formed. The contract can be viewed here.

From the second round and onward we will only withdraw 300k max per month for Supremacy development costs. This will reduce as we work towards becoming as lean and decentralized as possible but where we can still deliver and meet projected timelines. 

This will include:
- Reduction of project expenses where possible
- Reduction in infrastructure costs as we implement Project Resilience (see FAQ for more detail)


## The Treasury will Support

Development salaries and expenses, Server and IT costs.

This target may reduce per round depending on outgoings and staff numbers however until we are out of the woods our hiring freeze will continue and monthly burn will not exceed this amount.

We will never draw more than our monthly set target from the treasury unless DAO approved.


## The Fine Details

Every 28 days we will open a new round to distribute Governance Tokens for contributors over a period of 12 months excluding the initial round. 

Round One will only be open for seven days. This is to support current staff and provide the immediate relief we require. 

### If we do not hit our softcap target we will automatically refund all contributors.

If the target is not hit by the set date for Round One close, all contributions will be automatically refunded to the wallets they came from and we will start the process of shutting down the company.

If Round One is successful, Subsequent rounds will stay open for the full 28 days and any funds contributed that exceed the target amount will be transferred to the DAO treasury at the end of the month.  This amount will remain in the treasury and may be used to help fill future rounds. 

A new round will start fresh every 28 days with a reduction in governance voting power received per dollar (see governance emissions schedule).

At the close of a successful Round One, All contributions will be moved to a Treasury wallet that will function as the DAO treasury. We will also transfer the existing SUPS treasury, game servers and IP ownership to the DAO.



## The Finer Fine Details

The governance token will initially come in the form of ERC1155 tokens which will need to be deposited at a future date to receive your ERC20 DAO tokens once we have finalised our DAO infrastructure.

20% of the amount of DAO tokens generated by each round close will be minted and reserved for the team. That's right, you heard correctly - only 20%. 

In addition to this initial amount, the DAO will be allowed to further mint a maximum of a further 10% of total tokens at the end of round 12 to be distributed through in game mechanisms only. This will help ensure the individuals most emotionally invested in the game have an opportunity to have a say in the future.

All other governance tokens will only be created through monthly contributions and delivered in line with the voting power emissions schedule outlined in this article.

We will be scheduling an AMA very soon to discuss this with our community directly.
